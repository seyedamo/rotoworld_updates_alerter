# Rotoworld Updates Alerter

## Purpose
As a sports fan and a fantasy sports aficionado, it's annoying and time-consuming to constantly check Rotoworld for relevant fantasy information, especially when it comes to injuries and who is starting.

I initially envisioned a text message-based news alerting service, but currently, the service sends email messages to subscribers whenever a new Rotoworld player news article is found.

## NBA
Currently, the service only supports new Rotoworld player news articles for the NBA -- specifically articles found [here](http://rotoworld-updates.herokuapp.com/player_news/)

This is what a sample email looks like
