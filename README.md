# Rotoworld Updates Alerter

## Purpose
As a sports fan and a fantasy sports aficionado, it's annoying and time-consuming to constantly check Rotoworld for relevant fantasy information, especially when it comes to injuries and who is starting.

I initially envisioned a text message based service, but the service currently sends email messages to subscribers whenever a new Rotoworld player news article is found.
